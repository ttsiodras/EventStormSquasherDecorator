    """
    This decorator 'squashes' bursts of calls to the decorated
    function with inter-arrival times less than 'milliseconds'
    into a single one - the last one that was ever made. To do
    that, it keeps track (via time.time() ) of the time each
    call is made, queues a closure-d version inside "delayed_calls",
    and only executes the last one AFTER the provided milliseconds
    have passed and no new call has arrived.

    This decorator is used to handle the unexplained (as of yet)
    bursts of events sent by the CHEOPS GTK widgets.

    Note that it can only be used for functions that DONT return
    anything - since the 'squashing' means that they will be
    executed in the context of a timer (no returning of anything
    to the caller).
